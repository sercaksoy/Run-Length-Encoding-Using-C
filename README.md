# Run-Length-Encoding-Using-C
<p>Run-length encoding (RLE) is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. Consider, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, and animations. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size.</p>

<p>A program which is encoding(run-length) integer matrices using C programming language. I did it the way it should meet professors wishes at <i>BLM1011_Assignment.pdf</i>. </p>
" <i>screenshots</i> " folder contains different screenshots from the program.</br>
" <i>BLM1011_Assignment.pdf</i> " is professors requests. If you came a way to do better you can always e-mail me !
